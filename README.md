This code is from a sample from my current research assistantship. I want to analyze the FOMC meeting minutes sentence by sentence.
The given data is formatted with an entire section in one row of the dataset, with another column for the section header and meeting date. This script takes 
that dataset as input and returns an excel file with a sheet for each meeting date. In each sheet the sentences are separated into rows with a column for the section header and word count of the sentence.
